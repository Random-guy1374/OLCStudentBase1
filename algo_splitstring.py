# Task 4
# Open a now Jupyterlab notebook and save the file as:
# TASK4_<your_name>_<your_class>_<index_number>.ipynb

# The task is to write a function remove_word(phrase) that removes
# consecutive repeated words in a phrase. The program:
# >> allows the user to input a phrase and convert to lower case [1]
# >> converts the phrase into a list of words. 
#     Do this without the help of the builtin
#     strings function such as str.split() [3]
# >> removes consecutive repeated words from the list [3]
# >> converts the list back into a new phrase. 
#      Do this without the help of the built-in
#     string functions such as str.join() [2]
# >> returns and displays the new phrase. [1]

# Save your Jupyterlab notebook for Task 4.

# Sample Output 1:
# Enter a phrase: Im a big big girl in a big big world
# New phrase: im a big girl in a big world

# Sample Output 2:
# Enter a phrase: Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry naega naega
# New phrase: sorry naega

    #     # find the position of the " " separator from previous position
    #     position_separator = phrase.find(separator, previous_position)

    #     # if no separator found, means its the last word.

    #         break

    #     # slice the word from previous position, to the next separator
    #     wordpart = phrase[previous_position:position_separator]

    #     # advance the previous position to next letter
    #     previous_position = position_separator + len(separator)
